## Feedback and Discussion

Public input is collected through:

- **GitHub Discussions** — conceptual feedback, critique, proposals, and governance model  
- **GitHub Issues** — concrete improvements, clarifications, and document changes  

Constructive criticism and alternative approaches are explicitly welcome.

---

## Versioning

The document follows a simple versioning structure:

- **v1.0.x** — editorial clarifications, wording improvements, non-structural changes  
- **v1.1** — extended clarification, additions, or refined definitions (no structural break)  
- **v2.0** — structural revisions, formalization, or technical specification

## Conflicts of Interest

Compute Sponsoring is an open proposal. Contributions are welcome regardless of institutional or commercial affiliation.

## Governance (in preparation)

The formal governance model is currently under development. Proposals and suggestions are explicitly welcome.

Discussion takes place in GitHub Discussions under the thread:
“Process and Governance”.

The goal is to establish a governance model that ensures:
- transparency   
- integrity of revisions  
- independence of category development
